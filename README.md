# Week 1 Progress
This week I learned about algorithm Specification, including pre and post conditions. I also learned about Reduction, in which we abstract larger problems into smaller components to optimize runtime and stack memory usage in our algorithms. Additionally, I was introduced to Big O Notation, which expresses runtime growth as a function of the size of the input data set. I also learned Big O Notation for several common orders of growth, these include, O(1) or Constant growth, O(n) or Linear growth, and O(n^2) or Quadratic growth.
